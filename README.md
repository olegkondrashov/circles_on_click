# circles_on_click
In this tiny project I use the State hook for adding circles on page in exactly point where I clicked. I added 2 buttons for returning state on one step back (1 circle is removed) and forward (circle returned on the same point where it been), and on click on 3rd button - all circles just dropped down.
